### Al and future of Medicine
The future of standard medical treatment, in which a patient sees a computer before visiting a doctor, may be closer than we think. With advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), it appears that the days of misdiagnosis and treating symptoms rather than the fundamental cause of disease may be numbered. (Greenfield, 2019) Artificial Intelligence (AI) and access to "Big Data," along with emerging biotechnology advances, will fundamentally alter medical practice. Type II diabetes, for example, will no longer be considered a single condition. Many well-known diseases, such as liver or pancreatic cancer, will have hundreds of subtypes, each with its own treatment options. Diseases will transform the way we think about them. Clinicians will no longer be able to make diagnoses, remember disease names, medicine names, or management procedures without the assistance of computers. There will be a shift in the role of doctors as machine intelligence overtakes human intelligence in determining diagnosis and therapy. Machines cannot substitute clinical algorithms or human experience. It will take a long time to fully integrate or replace humans with machines. However, we must change our medical education system in order to adequately prepare the medical community and the general public for a peaceful transition. (Madhusudana Girija Sanal, 2019) The field of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine is rapidly expanding. In 2016, more money was invested in healthcare AI initiatives than in any other sector of the global economy.  However, among the elation, there is also skepticism, with some advocating caution in the face of unrealistic expectations.  This examines current advancements in medical AI as well as the implications for general practice. (Pract., 2018) According to Accenture Consulting, the artificial intelligence (AI) market in healthcare is estimated to reach $6.6 billion by 2021. From AI-based software for managing medical data to robotics helping surgeries, this revolutionary technology has paved the way for many breakthroughs. Despite the incredible progress, the sector is still in its infancy and is predicted to grow rapidly in the coming years, totally altering the business landscape.

## Providing healthcare assistance
Patient information is already in digital form, thanks to the rapid rise of wireless patient monitoring devices and wearables. Medical information is currently available on the internet for virtual assistants. Artificial intelligence-powered virtual assistants such as Siri, Cortana, Google Assistant, and Alexa are poised to become considerably more useful than simply hailing a cab. Researchers are currently focusing on using AI to power virtual assistants in order to improve medical word and clinical language recognition. This has the potential to revolutionize not only how healthcare professionals interact with EHRs, but also how patients comprehend their anatomy and constitution, become more engaged in the care process, and adhere to their drug regimens.


## What are Current Applications of AI in Medicine

**Medical image analysis** To diagnose or classify the severity of a disease, machine learning algorithms use computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, pathology image, fundus image, and endoscope data. In evaluating 466 small polyps, the machine learning method had a diagnosis accuracy of 94 percent and a negative predictive value of 96 percent when used to real-time colonoscopy.                                                                                                                                                          
**AI using electronic medical records** Various attempts to construct AI systems employing EMRs are now underway. Furthermore, IBM has created Watson for Oncology, which gives cancer patients with appropriate customized therapy, and clinical studies are currently underway. 43 Selvas AI and Linewalks, both based in Korea, are pursuing comparable research.  (Sci., 2020)                   
**Diagnose diseases** Diagnostics can be a lengthy and time-consuming process. Deep Learning algorithms have lately made significant progress in autonomously diagnosing diseases, reducing the cost and accessibility of tests. Machine Learning is useful in situations where a doctor's diagnostic information has already been digitized. For instance, CT scans can be used to detect lung cancer or strokes, cardiac death or other heart disorders, identifying skin lesions in skin images and classifying them, finding diabetic retinopathy signs in eye photographs, et cetera.     
**Develop drugs faster** Machine Learning can improve the efficiency of many of the analytical techniques used in drug development. This process goes through four stages starting from selecting intervention targets followed by discovering drug candidates, Speeding up clinical trials and finding Biomarkers for diagnosing the disease.                                                                                                                                 
**Personalize treatment** Diverse patients have different reactions to medications and therapy regimens. As a result, tailored treatment has a huge potential to extend patients' lives. However, determining which characteristics should influence treatment selection is difficult. Machine Learning can assist determine which variables indicate that a patient will have a certain response to a given treatment by automating this complex statistical work. As a result, the algorithm can forecast a patient's likely response to a given treatment (Schmitt).

## Limitations and Obstacles in the Medical Application of Artificially Intelligent Systems

Artificially intelligent systems have their own set of restrictions and obstacles in any industry, including healthcare. With regard to the drawbacks of new technology, the moment has come to shift our perspective from reactive to proactive. We'll talk about those issues here, with a focus on those that are relevant to healthcare.                                                                                                                                            
**Creating biased models and data** Artificial intelligent systems are then trained using a subset of the data collected, with the rest set aside for testing. As a result, if the data collected is biased, for example, if it targets a specific race, gender, or age group, the final model will be biased. As a result, the information gathered must accurately reflect the demographic for which it is intended.                   
**Choosing a model** with so many algorithms and models to choose from, it's important to pick the one that's best suited to the task at hand. As a result, the model selection procedure is crucial. Models that are overly basic and fail to reflect the trends in a dataset are known as bias models.                                          
**Blackboxes** Because of the intricacy of the mathematical procedures involved, artificial intelligent systems have a reputation for being blackboxes. It is necessary to make models more understandable and accessible. While there has been some recent success in this area, there is still work to do. (Dermatol., 2020)

## AI vs. Humans

AI is proving to be as dependable as physicians in diagnosing medical conditions. Researchers at a hospital in Oxford, England, have developed AI for predicting heart disease. According to their study, in 80% of the cases, the technology performed better than doctors in predicting cardiovascular diseases. Meanwhile, scientists at Harvard Medical School have developed a machine-learning-based microscope that can detect deadly blood infections with an astonishing 95% accuracy. (AI and the Future of Medicine). Patients must believe that consultations are being guided by human doctors since machines lack human traits such as empathy and sympathy. Furthermore, patients cannot be expected to trust AI right away, as it is a technology steeped in suspicion.  As a result, AI is frequently used to undertake activities that are necessary but restricted in scope, leaving the primary duty for patient treatment to a human doctor. A clinical research is currently underway to see if AI can compute target zones for head and neck radiation more precisely and faster than a person can. Although an interventional radiologist is still in charge of giving the therapy, AI plays a key role in shielding the patient from hazardous radiation.
